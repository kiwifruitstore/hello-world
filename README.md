this tutorial is asking me to write a bit about myself but i'm not quite sure how to do that without cringing at myself later
currently at this point in time I am 19, an aspiring mathematician (and programmer it looks like), and hoping to go off to a cool uni soon
if you happen to be reading this, i hope you're having a good day
